\title{Similarity matrix based upon the Spectral contrast Angle (SCA) between all cells}
\format{
a dist object containing the SCA between each cell in the dataset
}
\usage{
SCA.similarity
}
\description{
E. coli 2092 cultured in LB and NB, in biological triplicates at 28Â°C and
120 rpm on an orbital shaker.
After 24h, cells are measured using FCM and fixed with PFA.
They are measured that day (day1, all samples).
Here we check this biological variability and try to identify how many
phenotypes were induced. As a means of calculating the distance between two
spectra, a distance matrix of all pairwise comparisons was generated using 
the SCA.diss function.
